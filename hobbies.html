<h1> My Top 3 Hobbies </h1>

<h2> Playing Baseball </h2>
I have been watching baseball since I was about 6. I only started playing when I 
was 10 in 6th grade. I have been on 11 different baseball teams. I have baseball 
almost every single day and it has been a blast playing with all my friends and 
meeting new friends on different teams. This year I play for Bordentown Freshman, 
Bordentown JV, Hamilton Bulls and Liedtka Fuel. I play pitcher, pitcher catcher and 
third base. This year I have about 25 strikeouts in 18 innings pitched.

<h2> Playing/ Watching Fortnite </h2>
Ever since Fortnite came out I have really been into the game. Although before 
I ever played it I said I didnt like it because thats all every one talked about. 
Plus I had no way to play the game since I had an outdated console. Once I started 
to get into fortnite, I only played fortnite. I wouldn't play any other game besides 
fortnite because of how fun it was.

<h2> Fishing </h2>
I love to go fishing when I am bored or stressed out because of how fun it is and how it just 
relaxes me and when you catch a fish it is an amazing feeling. I go with my Uncle buddy who is 
an expert fisherman, Although one day I caught more fish than he did and I felt proud of my self. 
I would recommend fishing for anyone who feels down or stressed.
